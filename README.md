## Deployment

This project uses GitHub Pages for deployment. The `/docs` directory contains the production build of the application (not documentation) and is used by GitHub Pages. Our actual documentation is in the `/doc` directory.

When you run `npm run build`, Vite will output the production files to the `/docs` folder, which is then published automatically through GitHub Pages.
